My Gift Shop Website:
In this website,I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I have used online links for fonts, animations, and icons.
The data for products on this website is added in a separate JavaScript file, and I have displayed them on different pages using export-import with JavaScript.
I have also created a login and signup page on this website, where I have allowed users to login and signup, and I have used local storage to store users' data.
I have also implemented 'Add to Cart' functionality on the website, where I have saved the data of added products in local storage.
There is also a compare page where I have provided an option to compare products from different brands.
There are specific product details available, for which I have used query strings.
Each specific product detail includes a download button where I have attached a Word file containing detailed information that you can download.
